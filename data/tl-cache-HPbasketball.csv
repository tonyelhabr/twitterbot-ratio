It’s a back to back, yeah, it’s home, and yeah, the Celtics have been great in that spot under Stevens, but it’s a different team, and it’s still a back to back. 

It’s a West team so it doesn’t hurt tiebreakers. It’s fine."

Being on a back to back isn’t cancelled out by their being on one too. It’s still a game where things get weird because of the SEGABABA. LIke, it’s a really good win for Utah, but it doesn’t make it a worse loss for Boston because Utah was on one too. https://t.co/U6w9YZe63I"
