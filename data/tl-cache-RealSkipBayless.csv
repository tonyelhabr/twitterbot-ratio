On that night, LeBron will have played 85 more games than Michael Jordan did. Give LeBron the Durability and Longevity Award!"

KD is all-time sensitive. He will not be able to get over being called a ""b"" by an angry Draymond."

If only Brady had a Davante, a J Graham, an Aaron Jones, a Valdes-Scantling, an Equanimeous, even a Tonyan. If only Brady had a defense like the Pack Sack Attack. (Brady is 7-3, Rodgers 4-4-1 with a loss to Brady)."

Isn't throwing it away to avoid sacks - still sacked 7th most. He's protecting stats - now 17 TDs to 1 INT. Won't try to make a risky play. Why he's 22nd in QBR and 4-4-1. If he loves it, he cool-whips it."

Rodgers played in (and won) one Super Bowl NINE YEARS AGO! Since, he's 5-6 in playoffs. The 5 wins: Joe Webb, Dez catch, KirkCousins, Giants boat trip, Mason Crossbar from 56 &amp; 51"

x43139414,RealSkipBayless,2018-11-16T03:56:15Z,x1063279557149511680,321,30,Good throw by Aaron Rodgers to a top 10 receiver. Slightly underthrown. Great concentration by Davante to haul it in despite a near breakup by Shaq Griffin. Huge play.

Look for ARodg to subtly blame him. At this rate McCarthy will be Baker Mayfield's head coach next year."
