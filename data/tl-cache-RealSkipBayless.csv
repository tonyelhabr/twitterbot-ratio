If only Brady had a Davante, a J Graham, an Aaron Jones, a Valdes-Scantling, an Equanimeous, even a Tonyan. If only Brady had a defense like the Pack Sack Attack. (Brady is 7-3, Rodgers 4-4-1 with a loss to Brady)."

Isn't throwing it away to avoid sacks - still sacked 7th most. He's protecting stats - now 17 TDs to 1 INT. Won't try to make a risky play. Why he's 22nd in QBR and 4-4-1. If he loves it, he cool-whips it."

Look for ARodg to subtly blame him. At this rate McCarthy will be Baker Mayfield's head coach next year."
