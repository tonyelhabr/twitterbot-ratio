Among other things (cough California cough) Dems *are currently winning twice as many Senate seats up for election tonight as the Republicans.* OBV they have more votes. https://t.co/uEVxnxi8aD
x176210560,skepticalsports,2018-11-07T20:15:41Z,x1060264549004140544,11,2,One thing that seems to be getting lost in the horserace Senate coverage is extent that Dems wiped the floor with the GOP last night (currently 23-9 in called Senate races). The only reason GOP expanded majority is they weren‚Äôt wiped out *quite as badly* as they were 6 years ago.

They say ‚Äúraise‚Äù for bets, chip denominations make no sense, plus an opponent just called my large pot-sized bluff on the river with a 5-high. (I won with 6-high.)"
