  # set to `false` (i.e. nothing is posted). In this case, this value

  # is generated). It will cause the program to revert potential updates to the
  # data in `path_ratio_log_scrape` and `path_ratio_last_post`.
  # Additionally, this value supplements the usage of `post_delay` = `true`, so that
  # actions that would occur after posting a tweet get run. This is useful
  # for checking that the code would work when it comes time to actually make the post.
